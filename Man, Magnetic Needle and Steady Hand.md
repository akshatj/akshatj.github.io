# Man, Magnetic Needle and Steady Hand

It has been **10 years** since I became aware of code and how computers work, however, in those 10 years I haven't been able to build anything. I attribute much of this to not knowing how things work on a deeper level and not knowing where to look when I am stuck in a tricky problem. 

For this, I have decided to start from the ground up: Learn how computers work from the transistor level and work my way up to the operating system userspace level.

Will I succeed? Only time will tell.
